The security-by-design techniques developed by S&T take into account the legal constraints imposed by regulations (e.g., the use of a
second factor authentication to access healthcare data) to develop identity solutions that offer the best trade-off between security,
privacy, and usability.

S&T works on assessing legal compliance regulations of IT systems with emphasis on privacy restrictions.  In this context, S&T has developed
automated techniques for checking compliance with respect to the privacy regulations imposed by the EU.  This is a first substantial
step towards the development of techniques for aligning security (from a technological point of view) and privacy (from a legal point of
view) to improve the governance of data and services in the system.


**Our focus**:
- Automated compliance checking of legal provisions for privacy
- Compliance of high-level designs against EU Data Protection Directive (DPD)
- Porting it to General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- Data Protection Impact Assessment
- eIDAS, electronic IDentification, Authentication and trust Services
