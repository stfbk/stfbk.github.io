Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a suite of cryptographic protocols designed to provide confidentiality, integrity and authentication to the parties communicating via an unsecure channel. 
With four existing versions and a wide set of customizable elements (e.g., available cipher suites, extensions, certificates), its deployment requires a non-trivial amount of technical knowledge whose lack results in a time-consuming task.

**Our focus**: help administrators in deploying secure and compliant TLS instances.
