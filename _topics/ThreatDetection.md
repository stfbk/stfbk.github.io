Threat and anomaly detection play crucial roles in safeguarding systems
and networks from potential risks and are essential components of a
robust cybersecurity strategy. Threat detection involves identifying and
recognising potential cyber threats such as malware, hacking attempts,
or other malicious activities that can compromise the security and
integrirty of computer systems, networks, or data. Anomaly detection, on
the other hand, focuses on discovering abnormal or unusual patterns in
data that deviate significantly from the expected behavior. Applications
fiels include networks and cloud infrastructure, industrial control
systems, automotive, healthcare systems and many others.

**Our focus:**

- Monitoring of network and computing devices through software-defined
  networks and programmable data planes (e.g. eBPF, P4)
- Design and development of AI-based threat and anomaly detection
  algorithms
- Analysis of the effectiveness of the monitoring-detection-mitigation
  pipeline
