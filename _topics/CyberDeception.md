Cyber deception is a defensive technique that involves the deployment of
decoys (such as artifacts, configurations, or scenarios) with which an
attacker can interact unknowingly. By doing so, it reveals pertinent
information about the attacker\'s Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures
(TTPs), thereby granting the defender a strategic advantage and a
valuable source of data for cyber threat intelligence.

**Our focus:**

- Explore relevant scenarios and requirements for the application of
  cyber deception
- Formalisation and implementation of optimal and sub-optimal
  algorithms for the selection of the most appropriate decoys to
  deploy
- Development of automated and cloud-native cyber deception tools
