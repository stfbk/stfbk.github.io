funding: Next Generation EU (InnovAction)

goals: >
  This projects aims to support Nubee integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in their network traffic monitoring solution ARES. The initiative's  goal is to design a machine learning model capable of reducing the number of false positives currently detected by the solution. Moreover, the ideal final achievement is the development of a model capable of capturing the features of the benign traffic, thus confidently recognizing anomalies.
