    The outcome of EIT Digital's API Assistant Innovation Activity is STAnD. The Security Tools for App Development - STAnD - is a new plug-in that helps application programming interface (API) developers make their APIs secure. It does this by providing a managed security service capable of identifying potential vulnerabilities, together with a catalogue of code hardening techniques that help reduce their exploitation. While tools already exist to secure APIs, none has so far been available for ensuring their secure usage in application creation.
