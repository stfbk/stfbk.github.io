## Who we are

The Robust and Secure Distributed Computing (RiSING) research unit
focuses on the investigation of methods and the design and
implementation of platforms that guarantee efficiency, robustness and
security in distributed computing environments.

Our research on security on cloud and network infrastructure revolves
around offering adaptive and zero-trust defense to cloud-native
services, with special emphasis on striking the right balance between
minimizing security risks and maintaining the perceived service quality
for distributed applications. We have a long-standing experience on
infrastructure monitoring and control, as well as on resource and
service orchestration.

The unit pursues its research and development activities in the
following areas:

- Threat and Anomaly Detection and Mitigation: monitoring network and
  computing devices (through e.g. programmable data planes) to detect
  attacks (using AI or statistical methods) and counteract them
- Cyber Deception: algorithms and tools to lure attackers into decoys
  to gain insights on their behavior
- Service and Security Orchestration: automated networking and cloud
  computing solutions to effectively manage business and security
  applications

The RiSING unit lies within the [Cybersecurity center](https://cs.fbk.eu/) in [Fondazione Bruno Kessler](https://www.fbk.eu) (FBK).
