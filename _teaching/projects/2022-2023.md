          title: Countering rebroadcast attacks against remote identity proofing
          description: >
            Remote identity proofing procedures, increasingly employed for enabling online services, may involve the display and remote validation of physical identity documents through video cameras. This phase is exposed to so-called "recapturing" or "rebroadcast" attacks, where a digital image or video depicting the document is shown through a screen, acquired through the camera in place of the actual physical document, and potentially used as identity evidence [1]. The project focuses on the detection of such kind of cyberattacks by analyzing the video stream through deep learning architectures, and the empirical assessment of their performance in prescribed experimental scenarios.

          title: Cryptographic Revocation
          description: >
            There is a strong interest in privacy-enhancing technologies to satisfy the complex requirements of digital identity, in particular minimizing the personal data shared at each presentation, and preventing others from correlating the activity of digital identity credential holders between presentations. Important use cases are the Mobile Drivers' License (ISO 18013-5) and the European Digital Identity Wallet.
            Cryptographic accumulators, e.g., [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] are efficient protocols to prove set (non-)membership that have been proposed as privacy-enhancing credential revocation mechanisms for digital credentials, e.g., [6].
            During the internship, you will have an opportunity to consider theoretical and practical aspects of these technologies, to be agreed based on your interest and prior knowledge. We are particularly interested in a performance comparison of algorithms of interest, possibly using existing libraries (e.g., <a href="https://github.com/mikelodder7/accumulator-rs">https://github.com/mikelodder7/accumulator-rs</a>).

          title: "Empowering the Public to Protect Themselves: Developing a Web-based Assessment Tool for Promoting Awareness at Dissemination Events"
          description: >
            One of the strategic objectives of the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) to address the shortage and gap in cybersecurity skills is to increase user awareness among the general public and in primary and secondary education, as well as to strengthen training and promote cybersecurity in higher education [1]. To contribute to this effort, the Center for Cybersecurity is developing CyberQ, a web-based application that aims to assess users' cybersecurity awareness during dissemination events such as Notte dei Ricercatori and educational workshops in high and middle schools.
            The goal of this internship is to expand the inner structure, features, and user interface/user experience of the CyberQ prototype, as well as the set of predefined questions. This internship will give the student hands-on experience developing a useful and practical tool, as well as an in-depth understanding of the complexities of cybersecurity awareness.
            Students who participate in this internship will be able to contribute to the ongoing effort to raise cybersecurity awareness among the general public as well as in primary and secondary education. They will also be able to apply their knowledge and skills to develop a tool to promote cybersecurity in higher education and beyond.

          title: "Simulating Secure Communications: Developing a Customizable Library for Testing the Resilience of TLS Protocols"
          description: >
            One area that continues to pose challenges for experts is the secure communication protocols used to protect sensitive information online. One such example is the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol, which, despite being designed and formally tested by experts, is still vulnerable to newly discovered flaws.
            The goal of this internship is to design and develop a highly customizable, user-friendly library that can simulate different protocol fragments or entire handshake sequences in order to test the resilience of TLS and its implementations. This library will enable the simulation of a variety of scenarios, such as changes in cipher availability, extensions, and even unexpected behaviors. 
            Students will gain hands-on experience in developing a useful and practical tool as part of this internship, as well as an in-depth understanding of the complexities of secure communication protocols. They will also be able to contribute to the ongoing effort to improve internet security for all users.

          title: Video manipulation vs liveness detection
          description: >
            Liveness detection techniques are employed in fully or semi-automated video-based identification procedures in order to verify that the applicant is an actual human being. In this context, advanced impersonation attacks can be attempted by leveraging recent AI-based tools for fast manipulation and synthesis of videos depicting faces (so-called deepfakes), which represent a relevant threat for currently implemented liveness checks [1, 2]. The internship activity exploits existing video creation tools (such as dot and DeepFaceLab) and systematically tests their performance with respect to differently designed liveness checks [3].

          title: Attack patterns for Identity Management protocols
          description: >
            Identity Management (IdM) protocols are the protocols supporting Single-Sign On (SSO) which is an authentication schema allowing the user to access different services using the same set of credentials. Two of the most known IdM protocols are SAML 2.0 SSO and OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect. Several solutions for corporations like Google, Meta (Facebook) and for Public Administration like eIDAS and SPID are based on IdM protocols. We propose to define attack patterns for assessing the security of IdM implementations. This activity can include the implementation of a plugin.

          description: >
            Over recent years, technology has radically evolved in fields such as identity, security, biometrics and mobile applications. Technology has already transformed the world of border security and efficient processing of passengers, for example, through secure ePassports (also known as electronic Machine Readable Travel Documents or eMRTD), automated eGates, biometrics used to assure visa regimes, and mobile boarding pass. However, the story is far from complete. A newer generation of secure and efficient solutions is just beginning with the development of Digital Travel Credentials (DTC). The project aims to explore state of the art and compare existing approaches toward DTC.

          title: Key Recovery Protocols for Cryptographic Cloud-hosted Data Protection
          description: >
            Cryptographic Access Control (CAC) is often employed to protect the confidentiality of Cloud-hosted sensitive data from curious service providers while enforcing access control policies. In CAC, data are encrypted, and the secret decrypting keys embody the permission to access the encrypted data. Unfortunately, an eventual loss of these keys would result in the total loss of the encrypted data. The main goal of this project is to investigate the feasibility and use of key recovery mechanisms in CAC to mitigate eventual key losses [1]. Activities include literature research, high-level design and possibly implementation of the proposed approach in a tool [2] developed and actively maintained by the Security&Trust unit in FBK [3].

          title: Multi-Authority Attribute-based Encryption for Secure Access Control in Blockchain-based Applications
          description: >
            Given the limited trust and inherently centralized nature of Cloud-based applications, the Blockchain may be the solution to guarantee integrity and confidentiality of sensitive data in cross-organizational scenarios. However, the basic security properties offered by the Blockchain should be complemented with fine-grained access control (e.g., attribute-based access control - ABAC) enforced through cryptography (e.g., attribute-based encryption - ABE) for best security. The main goal of this project is to investigate how multi-authority ABE is and can be used in Blockchain-based applications to enforce cross-organizational ABAC policies.

          title: Privacy enhancing technologies for digital identity
          description: >
            There is a strong interest in privacy-enhancing technologies to satisfy the complex requirements of digital identity, in particular minimizing the personal data shared at each presentation, and preventing others from correlating the activity of digital identity holders between presentations. Important use cases are the Mobile Drivers’ License (ISO 18013-5) and the European Digital Identity Wallet, with a toolbox for the latter currently under development and expected to be first released in october 2022.
            Many technologies based on cryptography have been proposed to provide solutions for  credential status requests, selective disclosure of attributes, and unlinkability of credential presentations, such as cryptographic accumulators, zero-knowledge proofs, commitments, and blind signatures. During the internship, you will have an opportunity to consider theoretical and practical aspects of these technologies, to be agreed based on your interest and prior knowledge. Examples include:
            <ul>
              <li>Estimate <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/663">BBS+</a> performance vs hash lists, Merkle and verkle trees for selective disclosure.</li>
              <li>Use <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa-python">Ursa python wrapper</a> or <a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/node-bbs-signatures">node-bbs-signatures</a> to benchmark bbs performance vs alternatives.</li>
              <li>Use <a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/jsonld-signatures-bbs">jsonld-signatures-bbs</a> to generate a verifiable credential analogous to an MDL; compare and contrast.</li>

          title: Threat Modeling for Electronic Voting
          description: >
            There has been renewed interest in electronic and internet voting systems in recent years, due in part to the pandemic, and to logistic difficulties in collecting votes from abroad.
            Electoral systems have complex and unusual requirements, and electronic voting systems doubly so - see e.g. <a href="https://search.coe.int/cm/Pages/result_details.aspx?ObjectID=0900001680726f6f">Council of Europe Recommendations</a> and US <a href="https://www.eac.gov/voting-equipment/voluntary-voting-system-guidelines">voluntary voting systems</a> guidelines. While end-to-end verifiable systems show promise of increased trustworthiness for the public, electronic and internet voting systems have come under scrutiny for significant vulnerabilities [1, 2].<br />
            Threat modeling works to identify, communicate, and understand threats and mitigations within the context of protecting something of value. In this internship, the candidate will apply threat modeling tools and processes to the example of electronic voting.

          title: Trusted Execution Environments for Advanced Data Protection
          description: >
            Cryptographic Access Control (CAC) is often employed to protect the confidentiality of Cloud-hosted sensitive data from curious service providers while enforcing access control policies. Unfortunately, CAC usually incurs significant computational overhead that limits its applicability in real-world scenarios [1]. The main goal of this project is to investigate how Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) such as Intel SGX [2] can synergize with CAC to relieve these computational overheads and efficiently guarantee advanced data protection.

          objectives:
            - Familiarization and study of the state of the art in the use of TEEs for advanced data protection.
            - Evaluation of available techniques and design of a solution joining CAC with TEEs to reduce the cryptographic computational overhead.
            - Implementation of the proposed approach in a tool [3] developed and actively maintained by the Security&Trust unit in FBK [4].
