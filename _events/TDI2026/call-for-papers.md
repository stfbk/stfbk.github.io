We invite the submission of scientific contributions addressing topics relevant to the workshop themes. Submitted manuscripts must present original research, also in preliminary form, that does not substantially overlap with any previously published work or submissions under consideration by other venues.

# Submission Guidelines
Submissions must be in English and provided in PDF format, following the CEURART template (1-column layout). The template package, available at [this link](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/CEURART.zip), includes both ODT and LaTeX versions. For LaTeX users, the primary file to edit is `sample-1col.tex`. Authors familiar with LaTeX **are strongly encouraged** to use the LaTeX template, either locally or via Overleaf.

Submissions will be categorized into (page limits exclude references and well-marked appendices):
- **Regular Papers**: full-length research papers (from 10 to 12 pages).
- **Short Papers**: research papers presenting preliminary results (from 5 to 9 pages).

Submissions must be made through the [EasyChair conference management system](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tdi2026). When submitting, authors **must select the "Call for Papers" track**.

Papers must be submitted in a form suitable for **anonymous review**: no author names or affiliations may appear on the title page, and papers should avoid revealing their identity in the text. Authors should also take care in not including acknowledgments that help identify them (e.g., funding information, names of colleagues who gave feedback on the paper). When referring to your previous work, do so in the third person, as though it were written by someone else. Any source code or other material (e.g., data sets) which requires hosting must use anonymous services. This explicitly excludes hosting on GitHub or Google Drive (which could leak reviewer identities). Instead, authors are encouraged to use services such as [Anonymous GitHub](https://anonymous.4open.science/).

Failure to comply with the above requirements may result in rejection without review.

Please note that at least one author of each accepted paper must register for the workshop and present the paper in person.

# Workshop Proceedings
Accepted papers may be considered for inclusion in an open-access post-proceedings volume published by CEUR-WS.org within the [CEUR Workshop Proceedings](https://ceur-ws.org/) series, indexed by both Scopus and DBLP. By submitting a paper, authors confirm that their contribution complies with the CEUR-WS.org requirements for publication, as outlined in the "[Author and editor rights](https://ceur-ws.org/HOWTOSUBMIT.html#AUTHORRIGHTS)" section of the CEUR-WS.org website.
