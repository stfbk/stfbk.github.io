  description: To facilitate the adoption of cloud by organizations, cryptographic access control is the obvious solution to control data sharing among users while preventing partially trusted cloud service providers to access sensitive data. In this context, CryptoAC implements a state of the art role-based cryptographic access control scheme; CryptoAC comes with an easy deployment process, it supports 81 different architectures and it is cloud-independent, i.e., it can be seamlessly deployed in all major cloud service providers.

  description: > 
    PILLAR is a privacy threat modeling assistant that brings the power of large language models (LLMs) to the established LINDDUN framework. Simply feed PILLAR a natural-language system description, and it will transform it into comprehensive threat models with limited input from users. It provides three variants of LINDDUN threat modeling: SIMPLE, LINDDUN GO (by simulating multi-agent collaboration in a virtual threat modeling workshop), and PRO.
